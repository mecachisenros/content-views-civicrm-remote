# Content Views CiviCRM Remote

WordPress plugin for [Content Views CiviCRM](https://github.com/mecachisenros/content-views-civicrm) that adds the ability to use a remote instance of CiviCRM.

Install and setup the remote settings by providing the `server` (remote server url), `path` (REST path url, i.e. `/wp-content/civicrm/extern/rest.php` or `/wp-json/civicrm/v3/rest` if you are using the [CiviCRM REST Api](https://github.com/mecachisenros/civicrm-wp-rest) plugin), `key` (remote site key), and `api_key` (the user api key), by navigating to the plugin's settings.
